## Attributions

Uses the [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) javascript code editor.

#CSL finder

Another proof-of-concept hack. Allows you to search for a citation style given only the formatted output. It calculates the edit distance of your input against all of the master styles in a snapshot of the [CSL styles github repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) to find the closest match.
